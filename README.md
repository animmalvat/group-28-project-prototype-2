# group-28-project-prototype-2
this is prototype for our split bill application

# Setup
1. You have to install tesseract
    https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Downloads
2. You must install pytesseract 
      ```pip install pytesseract```
3. You must install pillow for image manipulation
      ```pip install pillow```

Then you can run the prototype, but remember to map the tesseract installation and image file name. (as it is just a protoype, we haven't included it to be user defined)
